{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "9244177","text":"Nuclear localization of a complex of fibroblast growth factor(FGF)-1 and an NH2-terminal fragment of FGF receptor isoforms R4 and R1alpha in human liver cells. FGF ligands and FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) appear associated with the nucleus in addition to their extracellular and transmembrane locations. After receptor-dependent internalization in liver cells, radiolabeled 16-kDa FGF-1 appears in a 40-kDa covalent complex with a cellular protein. In this report, we show that in a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, which expresses both FGFR4 and FGFR1, the 40-kDa complex cross-reacts with antibodies against the ectodomain of both types of receptors. In addition to antibody against FGF-1, a polyclonal antiserum against the three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like loop ectodomain of FGFR4 and a monoclonal antibody to a 19-residue sequence in the NH2-terminus of the NH2-terminal Ig Loop I of the three loop splice variant of FGFR1 (FGFR1alpha) reacts with the complex. A monoclonal antibody against an epitope in FGFR1 downstream of the inter-loop I/II sequence which reacts with intact FGFR1 failed to cross-react with the 40-kDa complex. Cell fractionations and indirect immunofluorescent localization revealed that the 40-kDa complex associates with the particulate fraction of cells, particularly the nucleus and associated cytoskeletal elements. We propose that the NH2-terminal Ig-loop of the three loop isoforms of FGFR, which are generally associated inversely with cell growth, may play a role at or in the nucleus in addition to modification of affinity of the FGFR ectodomain for heparan sulfate and FGF ligand.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":141,"end":146}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":477,"end":482}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":192,"end":197}},{"obj":"Gene:2246","span":{"begin":37,"end":68}},{"obj":"Gene:2246","span":{"begin":375,"end":380}},{"obj":"Gene:2264","span":{"begin":531,"end":536}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":541,"end":546}},{"obj":"Gene:2246","span":{"begin":679,"end":684}},{"obj":"Gene:2264","span":{"begin":771,"end":776}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":914,"end":919}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1002,"end":1007}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1076,"end":1081}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1373,"end":1375}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:29345","span":{"begin":1360,"end":1363}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:29345","span":{"begin":855,"end":858}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:29345","span":{"begin":835,"end":838}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:29345","span":{"begin":76,"end":79}},{"obj":"Disease:D006528","span":{"begin":483,"end":491}}]}
