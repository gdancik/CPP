{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "21543745","text":"NP603, a novel and potent inhibitor of FGFR1 tyrosine kinase, inhibits hepatic stellate cell proliferation and ameliorates hepatic fibrosis in rats. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and its main receptor FGFR1 have been shown to promote hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and proliferation. However, scant information is available on the anti-fibrogenic activity of FGFR1 inhibitors. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a selective FGFR1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor NP603 on HSC proliferation and hepatic fibrosis. We demonstrated that rat primary HSCs secreted significant amounts of FGF-2, and its tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1 was attenuated by NP603. NP603 inhibited HSC activaton by measuring the expression of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and the production of type I collagen using ELISA. Furthermore, NP603 (25  M) in vitro strongly suppressed HSC growth induced by FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) and FCS. This effect correlated with the suppression of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activity and its downstream targets cyclin D1 and p21. In addition, PO NP603 (20 mg  kg(-1)  day(-1)) administration significantly decreased hepatic collagen deposition and a-SMA expression in CCl(4)-treated rats. Collectively, these studies suggest that selective blocking of the FGFR1-mediated pathway could be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":143,"end":147}},{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":554,"end":557}},{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":1215,"end":1219}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":149,"end":175}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":177,"end":182}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":39,"end":44}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":206,"end":211}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":372,"end":377}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":452,"end":457}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":603,"end":608}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":646,"end":651}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":897,"end":902}},{"obj":"Gene:58919","span":{"begin":1043,"end":1052}},{"obj":"Gene:24525","span":{"begin":1057,"end":1060}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":1288,"end":1293}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:27385","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1206}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1075,"end":1083}},{"obj":"Chemical:C561467","span":{"begin":832,"end":837}},{"obj":"Chemical:C561467","span":{"begin":677,"end":682}},{"obj":"Chemical:C561467","span":{"begin":670,"end":675}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:18186","span":{"begin":618,"end":626}},{"obj":"Chemical:C561467","span":{"begin":484,"end":489}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:18186","span":{"begin":458,"end":466}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:18186","span":{"begin":45,"end":53}},{"obj":"Chemical:C561467","span":{"begin":0,"end":5}},{"obj":"Disease:D008103","span":{"begin":123,"end":139}},{"obj":"Disease:D008103","span":{"begin":515,"end":531}},{"obj":"Disease:D008103","span":{"begin":1374,"end":1390}}]}
