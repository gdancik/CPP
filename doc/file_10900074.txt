{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "10900074","text":"Fibroblast growth factor-9 modulates the expression of myelin related proteins and multiple fibroblast growth factor receptors in developing oligodendrocytes. The effect of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-9 on the expression of FGF receptors (FGFR) and the major myelin proteins was examined in cultures of developing rat brain oligodendrocytes (OLs), using immunological techniques. FGFR-1, -3, and -4 were expressed at all developmental stages but were not present in isolated myelin fractions. By contrast, FGFR-2 protein was predominantly localized to differentiating cells and myelin. FGF-9 altered FGFR and myelin protein levels during OL differentiation; there was increased expression of FGFR-1 and decreased levels of both FGFR-2 and myelin proteins. Further, FGF-9 stimulated mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. The effect of FGF-9 on MAPK, however, was transient and less robust in progenitor cells than in differentiated oligodendrocytes. The effects of FGF-9 and FGF-2 on FGFR and myelin protein levels were comparable; both up-regulated FGFR-1, and down-regulated FGFR-2, CNP, PLP and MBP. These findings suggest that FGF-9 may be important for glial cell development.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":317,"end":320}},{"obj":"Gene:25444","span":{"begin":0,"end":26}},{"obj":"Gene:25444","span":{"begin":173,"end":205}},{"obj":"Gene:79114;84489;25114","span":{"begin":383,"end":401}},{"obj":"Gene:25022","span":{"begin":509,"end":515}},{"obj":"Gene:25444","span":{"begin":589,"end":594}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":695,"end":701}},{"obj":"Gene:25022","span":{"begin":731,"end":737}},{"obj":"Gene:25444","span":{"begin":768,"end":773}},{"obj":"Gene:25444","span":{"begin":857,"end":862}},{"obj":"Gene:25444","span":{"begin":987,"end":992}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":997,"end":1002}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":1072,"end":1078}},{"obj":"Gene:25022","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1105}},{"obj":"Gene:25275","span":{"begin":1107,"end":1110}},{"obj":"Gene:24943","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1115}},{"obj":"Gene:24547","span":{"begin":1120,"end":1123}},{"obj":"Gene:25444","span":{"begin":1153,"end":1158}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1120,"end":1123}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1115}},{"obj":"Disease:C563602","span":{"begin":1120,"end":1123}}]}
