{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "11739186","text":"The t(8;22) in chronic myeloid leukemia fuses BCR to FGFR1: transforming activity and specific inhibition of FGFR1 fusion proteins. This report describes 2 patients with a clinical and hematologic diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase who had an acquired t(8;22)(p11;q11). Analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated that both patients were negative for the BCR-ABL fusion, but suggested that the BCR gene was disrupted. Further FISH indicated a breakpoint within fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), the receptor tyrosine kinase that is known to be disrupted in a distinctive myeloproliferative disorder, most commonly by fusion to ZNF198. RT-PCR confirmed the presence in both cases of an in-frame messenger RNA fusion between BCR exon 4 and FGFR1 exon 9. Expression of BCR-FGFR1 in the factor-dependent cell line Ba/F3 resulted in interleukin 3-independent clones that grew at a comparable rate to cells transformed with ZNF198-FGFR1. The growth of transformed cells was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, the farnesyltransferase inhibitors L744832 and manumycin A, the p38 inhibitors SB202190 and SB203580 but not by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. The growth of BaF3/BCR-FGFR1 and BaF3/ZNF198-FGFR1 was not significantly inhibited by treatment with STI571, but was inhibited by SU5402, a compound with inhibitory activity against FGFR1. Inhibition with this compound was associated with decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and BCR-FGFR1 or ZNF198-FGFR1, and was dose dependent with an inhibitory concentration of 50% of approximately 5 microM. As expected, growth of BaF3/BCR-ABL was inhibited by STI571 but not by SU5402. The study demonstrates that the BCR-FGFR1 fusion may occur in patients with apparently typical CML. Patients with constitutively active FGFR1 fusion genes may be amenable to treatment with specific FGFR1 inhibitors.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":156,"end":164}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":431,"end":439}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":1829,"end":1837}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":1867,"end":1875}},{"obj":"Gene:613","span":{"begin":46,"end":49}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":53,"end":58}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":109,"end":114}},{"obj":"Gene:8909","span":{"begin":286,"end":289}},{"obj":"Gene:25","span":{"begin":462,"end":469}},{"obj":"Gene:613","span":{"begin":501,"end":504}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":568,"end":603}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":605,"end":610}},{"obj":"Gene:7750","span":{"begin":745,"end":751}},{"obj":"Gene:613","span":{"begin":841,"end":844}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":856,"end":861}},{"obj":"Gene:613;2260","span":{"begin":884,"end":893}},{"obj":"Gene:3562","span":{"begin":946,"end":959}},{"obj":"Gene:7750","span":{"begin":1036,"end":1042}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1043,"end":1048}},{"obj":"Gene:5594","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1220}},{"obj":"Gene:5609","span":{"begin":1269,"end":1272}},{"obj":"Gene:613;2260","span":{"begin":1311,"end":1320}},{"obj":"Gene:7750","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1336}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1337,"end":1342}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1474,"end":1479}},{"obj":"Gene:5595;5594","span":{"begin":1560,"end":1566}},{"obj":"Gene:613;2260","span":{"begin":1571,"end":1580}},{"obj":"Gene:7750","span":{"begin":1584,"end":1590}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1591,"end":1596}},{"obj":"Gene:25","span":{"begin":1716,"end":1723}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1803,"end":1808}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1903,"end":1908}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1965,"end":1970}},{"obj":"Chemical:C105686","span":{"begin":1759,"end":1765}},{"obj":"Chemical:C097613","span":{"begin":1741,"end":1747}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1711,"end":1715}},{"obj":"Chemical:C105686","span":{"begin":1422,"end":1428}},{"obj":"Chemical:C097613","span":{"begin":1393,"end":1399}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1325,"end":1329}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1306,"end":1310}},{"obj":"Chemical:C093973","span":{"begin":1283,"end":1290}},{"obj":"Chemical:C093642","span":{"begin":1245,"end":1253}},{"obj":"Chemical:C090942","span":{"begin":1232,"end":1240}},{"obj":"Chemical:C054474","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1211}},{"obj":"Chemical:C096898","span":{"begin":1188,"end":1195}},{"obj":"Chemical:C085911","span":{"begin":1143,"end":1151}},{"obj":"Chemical:D010716","span":{"begin":1103,"end":1123}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:18186","span":{"begin":626,"end":634}},{"obj":"Disease:D015464","span":{"begin":15,"end":39}},{"obj":"Disease:D015464","span":{"begin":210,"end":234}},{"obj":"Disease:D015464","span":{"begin":236,"end":239}},{"obj":"Disease:D009196","span":{"begin":689,"end":716}},{"obj":"Disease:D015464","span":{"begin":1862,"end":1865}}]}
