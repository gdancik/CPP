{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "18480558","text":"Primary amenorrhea in an 18-year-old Japanese female with sensorineural hearing loss and anosmia: a new sydrome? This report documents a case with primary amenorrhea associated with sensorineural hearing loss and anosmia. The patient presented at 18 years of age with minimal sexual development and no prior menses. Her mother also presented late onset menarche, hearing loss and anosmia, and her father was also affected with hearing loss. A chromosome analysis of the patient showed 46, XX. Basal FSH and LH levels were in normal range, but the serum estradiol level was low. A serum estradiol elevation and follicular development were recognized after the injection of human menopausal gonadotropin. Genomic DNA sequencing of FSHB, FSHR, KAL1, FGFR1, PROK2 and PROKR2 did not show any mutation. Audiometry showed severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and smell testing confirmed a severely impaired olfactory function. These findings probably suggested a case of delayed puberty associated with sensorineural hearing loss and anosmia.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":226,"end":233}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":470,"end":477}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":672,"end":677}},{"obj":"Gene:2488","span":{"begin":729,"end":733}},{"obj":"Gene:2492","span":{"begin":735,"end":739}},{"obj":"Gene:3730","span":{"begin":741,"end":745}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":747,"end":752}},{"obj":"Gene:60675","span":{"begin":754,"end":759}},{"obj":"Gene:128674","span":{"begin":764,"end":770}},{"obj":"Chemical:D004958","span":{"begin":586,"end":595}},{"obj":"Chemical:D004958","span":{"begin":553,"end":562}},{"obj":"Disease:D000568","span":{"begin":8,"end":18}},{"obj":"Disease:D000568","span":{"begin":155,"end":165}},{"obj":"Disease:D006319","span":{"begin":58,"end":84}},{"obj":"Disease:D006319","span":{"begin":182,"end":208}},{"obj":"Disease:D000857","span":{"begin":89,"end":96}},{"obj":"Disease:D000857","span":{"begin":213,"end":220}},{"obj":"Disease:D034381","span":{"begin":363,"end":375}},{"obj":"Disease:D000857","span":{"begin":380,"end":387}},{"obj":"Disease:D034381","span":{"begin":427,"end":439}},{"obj":"Disease:D006319","span":{"begin":833,"end":859}},{"obj":"Disease:D011628","span":{"begin":980,"end":987}},{"obj":"Disease:D006319","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1030}},{"obj":"Disease:D000857","span":{"begin":1035,"end":1042}}]}
