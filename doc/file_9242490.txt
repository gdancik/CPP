{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "9242490","text":"Mesp2: a novel mouse gene expressed in the presegmented mesoderm and essential for segmentation initiation. We isolated a novel bHLH protein gene Mesp2 (for mesoderm posterior 2) that cross-hybridizes with Mesp1 expressed in the early mouse mesoderm. Mesp2 is expressed in the rostral presomitic mesoderm, but down-regulated immediately after the formation of the segmented somites. To determine the function of MesP2 protein (MesP2) in somitogenesis, we generated Mesp2-deficient mice by gene targeting. The homozygous Mesp2 (-/-) mice died shortly after birth and had fused vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia, with impaired sclerotomal polarity. The earliest defect in the homozygous embryos was a lack of segmented somites. Their disruption of the metameric features, altered expression of Mox-1, Pax-1, and Dll1, and lack of expression of Notch1, Notch2, and FGFR1 suggested that MesP2 controls sclerotomal polarity by regulating the signaling systems mediated by notch-delta and FGF, which are essential for segmentation.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:10090","span":{"begin":15,"end":20}},{"obj":"Species:10090","span":{"begin":235,"end":240}},{"obj":"Species:10090","span":{"begin":481,"end":485}},{"obj":"Species:10090","span":{"begin":532,"end":536}},{"obj":"Gene:17293","span":{"begin":0,"end":5}},{"obj":"Gene:17293","span":{"begin":146,"end":151}},{"obj":"Gene:17293","span":{"begin":157,"end":177}},{"obj":"Gene:17292","span":{"begin":206,"end":211}},{"obj":"Gene:17293","span":{"begin":251,"end":256}},{"obj":"Gene:17293","span":{"begin":412,"end":417}},{"obj":"Gene:17293","span":{"begin":427,"end":432}},{"obj":"Gene:17293","span":{"begin":465,"end":470}},{"obj":"Gene:17293","span":{"begin":520,"end":525}},{"obj":"Gene:17285","span":{"begin":800,"end":805}},{"obj":"Gene:18503","span":{"begin":807,"end":812}},{"obj":"Gene:13388","span":{"begin":818,"end":822}},{"obj":"Gene:18128","span":{"begin":850,"end":856}},{"obj":"Gene:18129","span":{"begin":858,"end":864}},{"obj":"Gene:14182","span":{"begin":870,"end":875}},{"obj":"Gene:17293","span":{"begin":891,"end":896}},{"obj":"Disease:D003072","span":{"begin":624,"end":653}}]}
