{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "8631326","text":"Isolation from spleen of a 57-kDa protein substrate of the tyrosine kinase Lyn. Identification as a protein related to protein disulfide-isomerase and localisation of the phosphorylation sites. A 57-kDa protein (p57) has been purified to homogeneity from a microsomal fraction of rat spleen. It is specifically and efficiently phosphorylated by the Src-like tyrosine kinase Lyn purified from the same source with a Km of 0.34 microM. The tyrosine kinases c-Fgr, Fyn, C-terminal Src kinase and p72syk, as well as the Ser/Thr-specific cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinases CK1 and CK2 do not phosphorylate p57. C-terminal Src kinase, which acts to down-regulate the Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases, almost completely prevents the protein phosphorylation catalysed by Lyn. Protein mass fingerprinting with tryptic fragments identified p57 as a protein related to protein disulfide-isomerase which belongs to the superfamily of Cys-Gly-His-Cys-containing sequences. Lyn phosphorylates tyrosine residues Y444, Y453 and Y466 which are located in a highly acidic region of the protein at the C-terminus. Upon phosphorylation, p57 forms a complex with Lyn which can be immunoprecipitated with anti-Lyn IgG. The association which occurs between the phosphorylated substrate and the SH2 domain of the kinase is consistent with the suggested 'processive phosphorylation' model, which implies that a primary phosphorylation site of the substrate binds to the SH2 domain of the enzyme and triggers the phosphorylation at secondary site(s).","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":280,"end":283}},{"obj":"Gene:246060","span":{"begin":212,"end":215}},{"obj":"Gene:81515","span":{"begin":75,"end":78}},{"obj":"Gene:25506","span":{"begin":119,"end":146}},{"obj":"Gene:81515","span":{"begin":374,"end":377}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":455,"end":460}},{"obj":"Gene:25150","span":{"begin":462,"end":465}},{"obj":"Gene:25155","span":{"begin":493,"end":499}},{"obj":"Gene:300250","span":{"begin":583,"end":586}},{"obj":"Gene:81650","span":{"begin":591,"end":594}},{"obj":"Gene:246060","span":{"begin":616,"end":619}},{"obj":"Gene:81515","span":{"begin":779,"end":782}},{"obj":"Gene:246060","span":{"begin":846,"end":849}},{"obj":"Gene:25506","span":{"begin":874,"end":901}},{"obj":"Gene:81515","span":{"begin":976,"end":979}},{"obj":"Gene:246060","span":{"begin":1133,"end":1136}},{"obj":"Gene:81515","span":{"begin":1158,"end":1161}},{"obj":"Gene:81515","span":{"begin":1204,"end":1207}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1100}},{"obj":"Chemical:D014443","span":{"begin":995,"end":1003}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:17561","span":{"begin":950,"end":953}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":938,"end":949}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:48343","span":{"begin":882,"end":891}},{"obj":"Chemical:D014443","span":{"begin":693,"end":701}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":621,"end":622}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:17489","span":{"begin":533,"end":537}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":467,"end":468}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":455,"end":456}},{"obj":"Chemical:D014443","span":{"begin":438,"end":446}},{"obj":"Chemical:D014443","span":{"begin":358,"end":366}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:48343","span":{"begin":127,"end":136}},{"obj":"Chemical:D014443","span":{"begin":59,"end":67}}]}
