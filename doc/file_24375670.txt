{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "24375670","text":"ERK1/2 signaling is essential for the chemoattraction exerted by human FGF2 and human anosmin-1 on newborn rat and mouse OPCs via FGFR1. Signaling through fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) is essential for many cellular processes including proliferation and migration, as well as differentiation events such as myelination. Anosmin-1 is an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein that interacts with the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) to exert its biological actions through this receptor, although the intracellular pathways underlying anosmin-1 signaling remain largely unknown. This protein is defective in the X-linked form of Kallmann syndrome (KS) and has a prominent role in the migration of neuronal and oligodendroglial precursors. We have shown that anosmin-1 exerts a chemotactic effect via FGFR1 on neuronal precursors from the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the essential role of the ERK1/2 signaling. We report here the positive chemotactic effect of FGF2 and anosmin-1 on rat and mouse postnatal OPCs via FGFR1. The same effect was observed with the truncated N-terminal region of anosmin-1 (A1Nt). The introduction in anosmin-1 of the missense mutation F517L found in patients suffering from KS annulled the chemotactic activity; however, the mutant form carrying the disease-causing mutation E514K also found in KS patients, behaved as the wild-type protein. The chemoattraction exhibited by FGF2 and anosmin-1 on OPCs was blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor U0126, suggesting that the activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway following interaction with the FGFR1 is necessary for FGF2 and anosmin-1 to exert their chemotactic effect. In fact, both proteins were able to induce the phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 kinases after the activation of the FGFR1 receptor.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":65,"end":70}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":80,"end":85}},{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":107,"end":110}},{"obj":"Species:10090","span":{"begin":115,"end":120}},{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":1008,"end":1011}},{"obj":"Species:10090","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1021}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":1205,"end":1213}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":1353,"end":1361}},{"obj":"Gene:5595;5594","span":{"begin":0,"end":6}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":71,"end":75}},{"obj":"Gene:3730","span":{"begin":86,"end":95}},{"obj":"Gene:14182","span":{"begin":130,"end":135}},{"obj":"Gene:3730","span":{"begin":333,"end":342}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":413,"end":448}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":450,"end":455}},{"obj":"Gene:3730","span":{"begin":559,"end":568}},{"obj":"Gene:3730","span":{"begin":782,"end":791}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":824,"end":829}},{"obj":"Gene:5595;5594","span":{"begin":918,"end":924}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":986,"end":990}},{"obj":"Gene:171059","span":{"begin":995,"end":1004}},{"obj":"Gene:14182","span":{"begin":1041,"end":1046}},{"obj":"Gene:3730","span":{"begin":1117,"end":1132}},{"obj":"Gene:3730","span":{"begin":1155,"end":1164}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":1430,"end":1434}},{"obj":"Gene:3730","span":{"begin":1439,"end":1448}},{"obj":"Gene:5595;5594","span":{"begin":1571,"end":1577}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1632,"end":1637}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":1655,"end":1659}},{"obj":"Gene:3730","span":{"begin":1664,"end":1673}},{"obj":"Gene:5595;5594","span":{"begin":1779,"end":1785}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1822,"end":1827}},{"obj":"Chemical:C113580","span":{"begin":1526,"end":1531}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1096,"end":1097}},{"obj":"Disease:D017436","span":{"begin":653,"end":670}},{"obj":"Disease:D017436","span":{"begin":672,"end":674}},{"obj":"Disease:D017436","span":{"begin":1229,"end":1231}},{"obj":"Disease:D017436","span":{"begin":1350,"end":1352}},{"obj":"Mutation:p|SUB|F|517|L","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1195}},{"obj":"Mutation:p|SUB|E|514|K","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1335}}]}
