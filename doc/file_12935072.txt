{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "12935072","text":"H+H2 thermal reaction: a convergence of theory and experiment. New experimental and theoretical rate constants for two isotopologs of the simplest chemical reaction, H+H2-->H2+H, are presented. The theoretical results are obtained using accurate quantum dynamics with a converged Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface and include non-Born-Oppenheimer corrections. The new experiments are carried out using a shock tube and complement earlier investigations over a very large T range, 167 to 2112 K. Experiment and theory now agree perfectly, within experimental error, bringing this 75-year-old scientific problem to completion.","denotations":[{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":0,"end":4}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":166,"end":170}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":166,"end":177}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":0,"end":1}}]}
