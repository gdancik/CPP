{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "27392636","text":"Comprehensive Screening of Gene Copy Number Aberrations in Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Solid Tumors Using Molecular Inversion Probe-Based Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Array. Gene copy number aberrations (CNAs) represent a major class of cancer-related genomic alterations that drive solid tumors. Comprehensive and sensitive detection of CNAs is challenging because of often low quality and quantity of DNA isolated from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) solid tumor samples. Here, in a clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory, we tested the utility and validated a molecular inversion probe-based (MIP) array to routinely screen for CNAs in solid tumors. Using low-input FFPE DNA, the array detects genome-wide CNAs with a special focus on 900 cancer-related genes. A cohort of 76 solid tumors of various types and tumor cellularity (20% to 100%), and four cancer cell lines were used. These harbored CNAs in clinically important genes (ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, KRAS, MYC) as detected by orthogonal techniques like next-generation sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization. Results of the MIP array were concordant with results from orthogonal techniques, and also provided additional information regarding the allelic nature of the CNAs. Limit-of-detection and assay reproducibility studies showed a high degree of sensitivity and reproducibility of detection, respectively. FFPE compatibility, ability to detect CNAs with high sensitivity, accuracy, and provide valuable information such as loss of heterozygosity along with relatively short turnaround times makes the MIP array a desirable clinical platform for routine screening of solid tumors in a clinical laboratory.","denotations":[{"obj":"Gene:2064","span":{"begin":958,"end":963}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":965,"end":969}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":971,"end":976}},{"obj":"Gene:3845","span":{"begin":978,"end":982}},{"obj":"Chemical:D010232","span":{"begin":449,"end":457}},{"obj":"Chemical:D005557","span":{"begin":433,"end":441}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":245,"end":251}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":291,"end":303}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":480,"end":485}},{"obj":"Disease:D030342","span":{"begin":586,"end":617}},{"obj":"Disease:D030342","span":{"begin":619,"end":622}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":662,"end":674}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":765,"end":771}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":802,"end":814}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":836,"end":841}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":878,"end":884}},{"obj":"Disease:D030342","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1115}},{"obj":"Disease:D030342","span":{"begin":1594,"end":1597}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":1659,"end":1671}}]}
