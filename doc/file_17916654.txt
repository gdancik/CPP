{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "17916654","text":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 signaling in pancreatic islet beta-cells is modulated by the extracellular matrix. Maintenance of pancreatic beta-cell mass depends on extracellular stimuli that promote survival and proliferation. In the islet, these stimuli come from the beta-cell microenvironment and include extracellular matrix deposited by associated vascular endothelial cells. Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) has recently been implicated as a signaling pathway that is important for normal beta-cell function. We would like to understand how extracellular matrix and FGFR1 signaling interact to promote beta-cell survival and proliferation. To examine beta-cell-specific receptor responses, we created lentiviral vectors with rat insulin promoter-driven expression of Venus fluorescent protein-tagged full-length (R1betav) and kinase-deficient (KDR1betav) FGFR1. Significant FGF-1-dependent activation of ERK1/2 was observed in betaTC3 cells, dispersed beta-cells, and beta-cells in intact islets. This response was enhanced by R1betav expression and reduced by KDR1betav expression. Plating-dispersed beta-cells on collagen type IV resulted in enhanced expression of endogenous FGFR1 that was associated with sustained activation of ERK1/2. Conversely, plating cells on laminin reduced expression of FGFR1, and this reduction was associated with transient activation of ERK1/2. Addition of neutralizing antibodies to inhibit beta-cell attachment to laminin via alpha(6)-integrin increased high-affinity FGF-1-binding at the plasma membrane and resulted in sustained ERK1/2 activity similar to cells plated on collagen type IV. These data show that the FGF-stimulated beta-cell response is negatively affected by alpha(6)-integrin binding to laminin and suggest regulation associated with vascular endothelial cell remodeling.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":749,"end":752}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":0,"end":35}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":388,"end":423}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":425,"end":430}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":590,"end":595}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":879,"end":884}},{"obj":"Gene:25317","span":{"begin":898,"end":903}},{"obj":"Gene:50689;116590","span":{"begin":928,"end":934}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":1202,"end":1207}},{"obj":"Gene:50689;116590","span":{"begin":1257,"end":1263}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":1324,"end":1329}},{"obj":"Gene:50689;116590","span":{"begin":1394,"end":1400}},{"obj":"Gene:25317","span":{"begin":1527,"end":1532}},{"obj":"Gene:50689;116590","span":{"begin":1590,"end":1596}}]}
