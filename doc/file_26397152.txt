UNASSIGNED: Aristolochic acid (AA) is a carcinogenic, mutagenic and nephrotoxic compound commonly isolated from members of the plant family of Aristolochiaceae (such as Aristolochia and Asarum) and used in Chinese herbal medicine. Use of AA and AA  -containing plants causes chronic kidney disease (CKD) and upper urinary tract carcinoma (UUC); however, the underlying mechanism remains to be defined. miRNAs regulate a number of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and metabolism. This study explored differentially expressed miRNAs between AA  -induced upper urothelial tract cancer (AAN  -UUC) and non  -AAN  -UUC tissues. Patients with AAN  -UUC and non  -AAN  -UUC (n=20/group) were recruited in the present study. Five tissue samples from each group were used for miRNA microarray profiling and the rest of the tissue samples were subjected to reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis including seven selected miRNAs for confirmation. A total of 29 miRNAs were differentially expressed between AAN  -UUC and non  -AAN  -UUC tissues (P<0.05). TargenScan and Gene ontology analyses predicted the functions and targeted genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs, i.e. Akt3, FGFR3, PSEN1, VEGFa and AR. Subsequently, expression of the selected differentially expressed miRNAs (Hsa  -miR  -4795  -5p, Hsa  -miR  -488, Hsa  -miR  -4784, Hsa  -miR  -330, Hsa  -miR  -3916, Hsa  -miR  -4274 and Hsa  -miR  -181c) was validated in another set of tissue samples. A total of 29 miRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed between AAN  -UUC and non  -AAN  -UUC tissues and these miRNA target genes in FGFR3 and Akt pathways, which regulate cell growth and tumor progression, respectively.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":761,"end":769}},{"obj":"Gene:10000","span":{"begin":1340,"end":1344}},{"obj":"Gene:2261","span":{"begin":1346,"end":1351}},{"obj":"Gene:5663","span":{"begin":1353,"end":1358}},{"obj":"Gene:7422","span":{"begin":1360,"end":1365}},{"obj":"Gene:574441","span":{"begin":1471,"end":1486}},{"obj":"Gene:442902","span":{"begin":1506,"end":1521}},{"obj":"Gene:2261","span":{"begin":1774,"end":1779}},{"obj":"Gene:207","span":{"begin":1784,"end":1787}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1562,"end":1565}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1541,"end":1544}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1523,"end":1526}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1506,"end":1509}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1488,"end":1491}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1471,"end":1474}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1448,"end":1451}},{"obj":"Chemical:C000228","span":{"begin":36,"end":53}},{"obj":"Chemical:C000228","span":{"begin":115,"end":132}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":85,"end":92}},{"obj":"Disease:D051436","span":{"begin":378,"end":400}},{"obj":"Disease:D051436","span":{"begin":402,"end":405}},{"obj":"Disease:D014571","span":{"begin":411,"end":440}},{"obj":"Disease:D014571","span":{"begin":442,"end":445}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":713,"end":719}},{"obj":"Disease:D014571","span":{"begin":727,"end":730}},{"obj":"Disease:D014571","span":{"begin":748,"end":751}},{"obj":"Disease:D014571","span":{"begin":781,"end":784}},{"obj":"Disease:D014571","span":{"begin":801,"end":804}},{"obj":"Disease:D014571","span":{"begin":1170,"end":1173}},{"obj":"Disease:D014571","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1193}},{"obj":"Disease:D014571","span":{"begin":1710,"end":1713}},{"obj":"Disease:D014571","span":{"begin":1730,"end":1733}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":1829,"end":1834}}]}
