The TERT promoter and FGFR3 gene mutations are two of the most common genetic events in urothelial bladder cancer (UBC), and these mutation assays in patient urine have been shown to be promising biomarkers for UBC diagnosis and surveillance. These results were obtained mainly from studies of patients with UBC in Western countries, and little is known about such information in Han Chinese patients with UBC. In the present study, we addressed this issue by analyzing tumors from 182 Han Chinese patients with UBC and urine samples from 102 patients for mutations in the TERT promoter and FGFR3 and TERT mRNA expression in tumors and/or urine. TERT promoter and FGFR3 mutations were identified in 87 of 182 (47.8%) and 7 of 102 (6.7%) UBC cases, respectively. In 46 urine samples from patients with TERT promoter mutation-carrying tumors, the mutant promoter was detected in 24 (52%) prior to operation and disappeared in most examined urine samples (80%) taken 1 week after operation. TERT mRNA was detected in urine derived from 46 of 49 patients (94%) that was analyzed before operation independently of the presence of TERT promoter mutations. Collectively, FGFR3 mutations occur at a very low rate in Han Chinese UBC and cannot serve as diagnostic markers for Chinese patients. Han Chinese patients with UBC have relatively low TERT promoter mutation frequency compared with patients in Western countries, and simultaneous detection of both mutant TERT promoter and TERT mRNA improves sensitivity and specificity of urine-based diagnosis.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":100,"end":108}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":291,"end":298}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":435,"end":443}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":533,"end":541}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":639,"end":647}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":684,"end":692}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":928,"end":936}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":1183,"end":1191}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":1416,"end":1424}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":1438,"end":1446}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":1523,"end":1531}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":0,"end":4}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":145,"end":149}},{"obj":"Gene:2261","span":{"begin":163,"end":168}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":28,"end":32}},{"obj":"Gene:2261","span":{"begin":46,"end":51}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":714,"end":718}},{"obj":"Gene:2261","span":{"begin":732,"end":737}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":742,"end":746}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":787,"end":791}},{"obj":"Gene:2261","span":{"begin":805,"end":810}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":942,"end":946}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":1129,"end":1133}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":1266,"end":1270}},{"obj":"Gene:2261","span":{"begin":1305,"end":1310}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":1476,"end":1480}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":1596,"end":1600}},{"obj":"Gene:7015","span":{"begin":1614,"end":1618}},{"obj":"Disease:D001749","span":{"begin":229,"end":254}},{"obj":"Disease:D001749","span":{"begin":256,"end":259}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":133,"end":139}},{"obj":"Disease:D001749","span":{"begin":352,"end":355}},{"obj":"Disease:D001749","span":{"begin":449,"end":452}},{"obj":"Disease:D001749","span":{"begin":547,"end":550}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":611,"end":617}},{"obj":"Disease:D001749","span":{"begin":653,"end":656}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":766,"end":772}},{"obj":"Disease:D001749","span":{"begin":878,"end":881}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":974,"end":980}},{"obj":"Disease:D001749","span":{"begin":1361,"end":1364}},{"obj":"Disease:D001749","span":{"begin":1452,"end":1455}}]}
