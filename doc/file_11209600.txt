{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "11209600","text":"Imprinting structural information from a GpG ligand into the configuration of a chiral diamine ligand through second-sphere communication in platinum(II) complexes. Cisplatin forms the cis-Pt(NH3)2(d(GpG)) cross-link with DNA. We have recently created novel d(GpG) conformations by using "retro models" (complexes having bulky carrier ligands designed to slow d(GpG) dynamic motion). Our results define four conformer classes: HH1, HH2, delta HT1, and delta HT2, with a head-to-head or head-to-tail base orientation and a phosphodiester backbone with a normal (1) or opposite (2) propagation direction. Moreover, each G residue can be syn or anti, and the base canting can be left-handed (L) or right-handed (R). Thus, 32 variants of cis-Pt(NH3)2(d(GpG)) are conceivable, but the adduct is too dynamic to study. Thus far, by using retro models, we have obtained evidence for five variants with d(GpG) but only four with GpG. We therefore selected Me2DAPPt(GpG) complexes for study by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy, and molecular mechanics and dynamics (MMD) calculations. Coordinated Me2DAP (N,N'-dimethyl-2,4-diaminopentane) has N, C, C, N chiral centers designated, for example, as R,R,R,R. This ligand has greater flexibility and more readily inverted N centers than ligands used previously in GpG retro models. One goal was to determine whether the GpG ligand can control the configuration of a carrier ligand. (R,R,R,R)-Me2DAPPt(GpG) forms the anti, anti HH1 R variant almost exclusively. Equal populations of the two possible linkage isomers of (S,R,R,R)-Me2DAPPt(GpG) are formed, both favoring the anti, anti HH1 R, variant; however, the isomer with the 5'-G cis to the S nitrogen has sharper signals, suggesting that interligand interactions are more favorable. Indeed, this linkage isomer was the major product of isomerization when (R,R,R,R)-Me2DAPPt(GpG) was kept at pH approximately 9.5 to allow N center equilibration. Steric clashes between the Me2DAP C-Me groups and the G O6 atoms found by MMD calculations appear to disfavor the HH1 conformer of (S,S,S,S)-Me2DAPPt(GpG) and (S,S,S,R)-Me2DAPPt(GpG) complexes. These two complexes have a significant population of the anti, syn delta HT1 conformer, as indicated by broad 1H NMR signals and by 31P NMR and CD data. Equilibration of (S,S,S,R)-Me2DAPPt(GpG) at pH 9.5 leads to a mixture of (S,S,S,S)-Me2DAPPt(GpG) and at least one isomer of (S,S,S,R)-Me2DAPPt(GpG). Thus, second-sphere communication (hydrogen bonding and steric interligand interactions) influences both GpG conformation and Me2DAP configuration.","denotations":[{"obj":"Gene:3730","span":{"begin":427,"end":430}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":432,"end":435}},{"obj":"Gene:23336","span":{"begin":635,"end":638}},{"obj":"Gene:3269","span":{"begin":1475,"end":1480}},{"obj":"Gene:3269","span":{"begin":1631,"end":1636}},{"obj":"Gene:3730","span":{"begin":2061,"end":2064}},{"obj":"Gene:23336","span":{"begin":2204,"end":2207}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":2569,"end":2575}},{"obj":"Chemical:D006859","span":{"begin":2478,"end":2486}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":2368,"end":2389}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:37971","span":{"begin":2273,"end":2276}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":2251,"end":2253}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":2107,"end":2128}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":2078,"end":2101}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":2001,"end":2005}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1974,"end":1980}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1857,"end":1880}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1692,"end":1702}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1566,"end":1579}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1430,"end":1453}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1107,"end":1139}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1105}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:37971","span":{"begin":991,"end":994}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":984,"end":986}},{"obj":"Chemical:C018309","span":{"begin":920,"end":923}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":141,"end":153}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:15571","span":{"begin":87,"end":94}},{"obj":"Chemical:D002945","span":{"begin":165,"end":174}},{"obj":"Disease:D006223","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1015}},{"obj":"Disease:D030342","span":{"begin":1034,"end":1066}},{"obj":"Disease:D030342","span":{"begin":1068,"end":1071}},{"obj":"Disease:D030342","span":{"begin":2021,"end":2024}},{"obj":"Disease:D006223","span":{"begin":2285,"end":2287}}]}
