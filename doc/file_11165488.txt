{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "11165488","text":"Expression of members of the Fgf family and their receptors during midfacial development. Members of the FGF family play diverse roles in patterning, cell proliferation and differentiation during embryogenesis. To begin to address their function during craniofacial development we have analyzed the expression of 18 members of the Fgf family (Fgf1-15, -17, -18 and -20) and the four members of the FGF-receptor family in the prospective midfacial region between E9.5 and E11.5 by whole-mount in situ hybridization. We show that at E9.5, Fgf3, -8, -9, -10 and -17 are broadly expressed in midfacial ectoderm. Concomitant with the outgrowth of the nasal processes at E10.5, expression of Fgf3, -8, -9, -10, -15, -17 and -18 was detected in spatially restricted regions of ectoderm at the edge of the nasal pit and at the oral edge of the medial nasal process. Expression of Fgf8, Fgf9, Fgf10 and Fgf17 was still observed in these domains at E11.5. In contrast to the restricted expression patterns of the ligands, FgfR1 and FgfR2 were broadly expressed in facial mesenchyme and ectoderm, respectively, indicating a wide competence of midfacial tissue to respond to FGF signaling.","denotations":[{"obj":"Gene:2248","span":{"begin":537,"end":541}},{"obj":"Gene:2248","span":{"begin":686,"end":690}},{"obj":"Gene:2253","span":{"begin":872,"end":876}},{"obj":"Gene:2254","span":{"begin":878,"end":882}},{"obj":"Gene:2255","span":{"begin":884,"end":889}},{"obj":"Gene:8822","span":{"begin":894,"end":899}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1012,"end":1017}},{"obj":"Gene:2263","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1027}}]}
