{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "21517068","text":"Acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrrole-based selective fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 (FGFR1) inhibitors: design, synthesis, and biological activity. A novel series of acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrrole derivatives as potent and selective inhibitors of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) were designed and synthesized. In silico target prediction revealed that tyrosine kinases might be the potential targets of the representative compound 2, which was subsequently validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for its selective and active FGFR1 inhibition of various tyrosine kinases. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis aided by molecular docking simulation in the ATP-binding site demonstrated that acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrrole carboxylic acid esters (2-5) are potent inhibitors of FGFR1 with IC(50) values ranging from 19 to 77 nM. Furthermore, these compounds exhibited favorable growth inhibition property against FGFR-expressing cancer cell lines with IC(50) values ranging from micromolar to submicromolar. Western blotting analysis showed that compounds 2, 3, and 2b inhibited activation of FGFR1 and extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2).","denotations":[{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":79,"end":84}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":235,"end":270}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":272,"end":277}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":541,"end":546}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":797,"end":802}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1117}},{"obj":"Gene:5594","span":{"begin":1122,"end":1163}},{"obj":"Gene:5595;5594","span":{"begin":1165,"end":1171}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":718,"end":765}},{"obj":"Chemical:D000255","span":{"begin":683,"end":686}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:18186","span":{"begin":569,"end":577}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:18186","span":{"begin":352,"end":360}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":160,"end":184}},{"obj":"Chemical:","span":{"begin":0,"end":24}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":948,"end":954}}]}
