{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "10720199","text":"Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of a truncated form of fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibits growth of glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and high affinity FGF receptor (FGFR) have been detected in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of many human gliomas, and are known to stimulate cellular proliferation and angiogenesis in the tumors. To investigate the effects of inactivation of FGFR on the growth of malignant gliomas, we constructed a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus vector encoding a truncated form of chicken FGFR1 (AxCA delta FR). AxCA delta FR-infected cells were confirmed to express truncated FGFR protein by immunoblotting and FGF-2-dependent clonogenicity of NIH3T3 cells was suppressed by infection with this virus vector. Then human malignant glioma cell lines U-251MG and T98G, both of which have been reported to express FGF-2 and FGFR, were infected with AxCA delta FR. These infected cells showed nuclear as well as cytoplasmic expression of a truncated FGFR protein. Proliferation rate and the ability to form colonies in soft agar of the cells infected with this virus vector were significantly suppressed compared with those of uninfected and lacZ-expressing adenovirus-infected cells. Moreover, intratumoral injection of AxCA delta FR significantly suppressed the subcutaneous tumor growth of the glioma cells in nude mice. We concluded that inactivation of the cytoplasmic and nuclear FGFR using this truncated FGFR-expressing adenovirus vector can inhibit the growth of malignant gliomas both in vitro and in vivo.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:10535","span":{"begin":0,"end":10}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":294,"end":299}},{"obj":"Species:10535","span":{"begin":529,"end":539}},{"obj":"Species:9031","span":{"begin":576,"end":583}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":810,"end":815}},{"obj":"Species:10535","span":{"begin":1249,"end":1259}},{"obj":"Species:10090","span":{"begin":1404,"end":1413}},{"obj":"Species:10535","span":{"begin":1519,"end":1529}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":182,"end":187}},{"obj":"Gene:396516","span":{"begin":584,"end":589}},{"obj":"Gene:14173","span":{"begin":707,"end":712}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":906,"end":911}},{"obj":"Disease:D005910","span":{"begin":110,"end":116}},{"obj":"Disease:D005910","span":{"begin":300,"end":307}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":383,"end":389}},{"obj":"Disease:D005910","span":{"begin":459,"end":476}},{"obj":"Disease:D005910","span":{"begin":816,"end":832}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":1368,"end":1373}},{"obj":"Disease:D005910","span":{"begin":1388,"end":1394}},{"obj":"Disease:D005910","span":{"begin":1563,"end":1580}}]}
