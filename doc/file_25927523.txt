INTRODUCTION: Deciduous and permanent human teeth represent an excellent model system to study aging of stromal populations. Aging is tightly connected to self-renewal and proliferation and thus, mapping potential molecular differences in these characteristics between populations constitutes an important task. METHODS: Using specifically designed microarray panels, Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT q-PCR), Western blot, immunohistochemistry and siRNA-mediated knock down experiments, we have detected a number of molecules that were differentially expressed in dental pulp from deciduous and permanent teeth extracted from young children and adults, respectively. RESULTS: Among the differentially regulated genes, high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), a stem cell-associated marker, stood out as a remarkable example with a robust expression in deciduous pulp cells. siRNA-mediated knock down of HMGA2 expression in cultured deciduous pulp cells caused a down-regulated expression of the pluripotency marker NANOG. This finding indicates that HMGA2 is a pulpal stem cell regulatory factor. In addition to this, we discovered that several proliferation-related genes, including CDC2A and CDK4, were up-regulated in deciduous pulp cells, while matrix genes COL1A1, fibronectin and several signaling molecules, such as VEGF, FGFr-1 and IGFr-1 were up-regulated in the pulp cells from permanent teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that deciduous pulp cells are more robust in self- renewal and proliferation, whereas adult dental pulp cells are more capable of signaling and matrix synthesis.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":135,"end":140}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":84,"end":89}},{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":749,"end":757}},{"obj":"Gene:8091","span":{"begin":835,"end":864}},{"obj":"Gene:8091","span":{"begin":866,"end":871}},{"obj":"Gene:8091","span":{"begin":1018,"end":1023}},{"obj":"Gene:8091","span":{"begin":1165,"end":1170}},{"obj":"Gene:1019","span":{"begin":1309,"end":1313}},{"obj":"Gene:1277","span":{"begin":1377,"end":1383}},{"obj":"Gene:2335","span":{"begin":1385,"end":1396}},{"obj":"Gene:7422","span":{"begin":1438,"end":1442}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1444,"end":1450}},{"obj":"Gene:100132417","span":{"begin":1455,"end":1461}}]}
