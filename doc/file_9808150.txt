{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "9808150","text":"Overexpression of basic fibroblast growth factor in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells: lack of correlation between inhibition of cell growth and MAP kinase activation. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF-2) is progressively lost from mammary epithelial cells as they become malignant. To investigate the effects of restoring the expression of bFGF in breast cancer cells, we constructed MCF-7 cells that permanently overexpress 18-kD cytoplasm-localizing bFGF (MCF-7/deltaA(FGF)(18) cells) and cells that express both the 18-kD along with the 22- and 24-kD nucleus-localizing bFGF peptides (MCF-7/NCF(FGF)(18,22,24) cells), using retroviral transduction. These stable cell constructs grew more slowly and had a larger fraction of their populations in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle than control cells. All forms of bFGF were eluted from MCF-7/NCF(FGF)(18,22,24) cell monolayers with 2 M NaCl, in contrast to fibroblasts that were demonstrated to secrete only the 18-kD bFGF isoform. High-affinity binding of 18-kD 125I-bFGF to these cells was significantly decreased, probably because of competitive binding by the autocrine-secreted bFGF. Recombinant 18-kD bFGF that was previously demonstrated in our laboratory to inhibit proliferation, activate MAP kinase, and induce the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 in MCF-7 cells, further inhibited MCF-7/deltaA(FGF)(18) cells but had no effect on MCF-7/NCF(FGF)(18,22,24) cells. The total cellular content of the high-affinity FGF receptors 1-3 was unchanged, but FGF receptor 4 was decreased in MCF-7/NCF(FGF)(18,22,24) cells. Both cell types overexpressing bFGF isoforms had elevated levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 but not that of p21WAF1/CIP1. In MCF-7/deltaA(FGF)(18) cells, FGFR1 and MAP kinase were constitutively phosphorylated. Exogenous recombinant 18-kD bFGF did not accentuate these effects but did induce an increase in the levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 corresponding to the further inhibition induced by exogenous bFGF in these cells. In MCF-7/NCF(FGF)(18,22,24) cells, FGFR1 and MAP kinase were not phosphorylated at baseline nor upon stimulation with recombinant bFGF, and exogenous bFGF only had a minimal effect on low steady-state p21WAF1/CIP1 levels. However, stimulation of these cells with phorbol ester or insulin did result in MAP kinase phosphorylation. While growth-inhibited in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, MCF-7/NCF(FGF)(18,22,24) cells retained active isoforms of cdk2 and the hyperphosphorylated form of Rb. These data suggest that high molecular weight forms of bFGF overexpressed in MCF-7 cells do not activate the receptor-mediated MAP kinase pathway, and do not induce p21WAF1/CIP1 in an autocrine manner, but inhibit proliferation through other, possibly direct nuclear signalling mechanisms.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":58,"end":63}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":166,"end":196}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":18,"end":48}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":198,"end":202}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":204,"end":209}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":347,"end":351}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":459,"end":463}},{"obj":"Gene:8817","span":{"begin":478,"end":485}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":580,"end":584}},{"obj":"Gene:4689","span":{"begin":601,"end":604}},{"obj":"Gene:8817","span":{"begin":605,"end":612}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":822,"end":826}},{"obj":"Gene:4689","span":{"begin":850,"end":853}},{"obj":"Gene:8817","span":{"begin":854,"end":861}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":976,"end":980}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":1026,"end":1030}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":1141,"end":1145}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":1165,"end":1169}},{"obj":"Gene:1026","span":{"begin":1325,"end":1329}},{"obj":"Gene:8817","span":{"begin":1377,"end":1384}},{"obj":"Gene:4689","span":{"begin":1419,"end":1422}},{"obj":"Gene:8817","span":{"begin":1423,"end":1430}},{"obj":"Gene:8817","span":{"begin":1493,"end":1496}},{"obj":"Gene:8817","span":{"begin":1530,"end":1533}},{"obj":"Gene:4689","span":{"begin":1568,"end":1571}},{"obj":"Gene:8817","span":{"begin":1572,"end":1579}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":1625,"end":1629}},{"obj":"Gene:1027","span":{"begin":1700,"end":1707}},{"obj":"Gene:1026","span":{"begin":1724,"end":1736}},{"obj":"Gene:8817","span":{"begin":1754,"end":1761}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1770,"end":1775}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":1855,"end":1859}},{"obj":"Gene:1026","span":{"begin":1945,"end":1949}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":2011,"end":2015}},{"obj":"Gene:4689","span":{"begin":2041,"end":2044}},{"obj":"Gene:8817","span":{"begin":2045,"end":2052}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":2067,"end":2072}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":2162,"end":2166}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":2182,"end":2186}},{"obj":"Gene:1026","span":{"begin":2233,"end":2245}},{"obj":"Gene:4689","span":{"begin":2426,"end":2429}},{"obj":"Gene:8817","span":{"begin":2430,"end":2437}},{"obj":"Gene:1017","span":{"begin":2479,"end":2483}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":2579,"end":2583}},{"obj":"Gene:1026","span":{"begin":2697,"end":2701}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:37532","span":{"begin":2295,"end":2308}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:26710","span":{"begin":894,"end":898}},{"obj":"Disease:D001943","span":{"begin":64,"end":77}},{"obj":"Disease:D001943","span":{"begin":355,"end":368}}]}
