{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "9161712","text":"Detection of polymorphic FGF receptor 1 mRNA in bovine lens epithelium by PCR. The expression of FGFR 1, 2 and 3 but not FGFR 4 was detected in bovine lens epithelial cells. FGFR 1 expression of both the 2-lg and 3-lg forms was detected by a difference in the lengths of the PCR products. Furthermore, mRNA which included or excluded six nucleotides corresponding to two amino acids in the acid box region of FGFR 1 was detected by a difference in mobility of the homo- and hetero-duplex strands formed in the PCR reaction.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:9913","span":{"begin":48,"end":54}},{"obj":"Species:9913","span":{"begin":144,"end":150}},{"obj":"Gene:281768;404193;281769","span":{"begin":97,"end":112}},{"obj":"Gene:317696","span":{"begin":121,"end":127}},{"obj":"Gene:281768","span":{"begin":174,"end":180}},{"obj":"Gene:281768","span":{"begin":409,"end":415}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:33709","span":{"begin":371,"end":382}},{"obj":"Chemical:D009711","span":{"begin":338,"end":349}}]}
