{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "25512530","text":"Genetic modifiers of EGFR dependence in non-small cell lung cancer. Lung adenocarcinomas harboring activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represent a common molecular subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. EGFR mutations predict sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and thus represent a dependency in NSCLCs harboring these alterations, but the genetic basis of EGFR dependence is not fully understood. Here, we applied an unbiased, ORF-based screen to identify genetic modifiers of EGFR dependence in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. This approach identified 18 kinase and kinase-related genes whose overexpression can substitute for EGFR in EGFR-dependent PC9 cells, and these genes include seven of nine Src family kinase genes, FGFR1, FGFR2, ITK, NTRK1, NTRK2, MOS, MST1R, and RAF1. A subset of these genes can complement loss of EGFR activity across multiple EGFR-dependent models. Unbiased gene-expression profiling of cells overexpressing EGFR bypass genes, together with targeted validation studies, reveals EGFR-independent activation of the MEK-ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathways. Combined inhibition of PI3K-mTOR and MEK restores EGFR dependence in cells expressing each of the 18 EGFR bypass genes. Together, these data uncover a broad spectrum of kinases capable of overcoming dependence on EGFR and underscore their convergence on the PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK signaling axes in sustaining EGFR-independent survival.","denotations":[{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":21,"end":25}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":127,"end":159}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":161,"end":165}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":248,"end":252}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":286,"end":290}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":421,"end":425}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":542,"end":546}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":561,"end":565}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":686,"end":690}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":694,"end":698}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":783,"end":788}},{"obj":"Gene:2263","span":{"begin":790,"end":795}},{"obj":"Gene:3702","span":{"begin":797,"end":800}},{"obj":"Gene:4914","span":{"begin":802,"end":807}},{"obj":"Gene:4915","span":{"begin":809,"end":814}},{"obj":"Gene:4342","span":{"begin":816,"end":819}},{"obj":"Gene:4486","span":{"begin":821,"end":826}},{"obj":"Gene:5894","span":{"begin":832,"end":836}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":885,"end":889}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":915,"end":919}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":997,"end":1001}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":1067,"end":1071}},{"obj":"Gene:5609","span":{"begin":1102,"end":1105}},{"obj":"Gene:2475","span":{"begin":1189,"end":1193}},{"obj":"Gene:5609","span":{"begin":1198,"end":1201}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":1211,"end":1215}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":1262,"end":1266}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":1374,"end":1378}},{"obj":"Gene:5609","span":{"begin":1432,"end":1435}},{"obj":"Gene:1956","span":{"begin":1469,"end":1473}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:18179","span":{"begin":1114,"end":1130}},{"obj":"Chemical:D014443","span":{"begin":291,"end":299}},{"obj":"Disease:C538231","span":{"begin":68,"end":88}},{"obj":"Disease:D002289","span":{"begin":40,"end":66}},{"obj":"Disease:D002289","span":{"begin":206,"end":232}},{"obj":"Disease:D002289","span":{"begin":234,"end":239}},{"obj":"Disease:D002289","span":{"begin":573,"end":578}}]}
