The study aims to explore the protection mechanism of exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (exo-bFGF) in brain ischemia. The first part of experiment was to determine the optimal time window for the permeation of exo-bFGF through damaged blood-brain barrier in rats with permanently occluded middle cerebral arteries. 125I labeled bFGF was administered to the rats through the caudal vein. The level of gamma-rays of 125I-bFGF in the ischemic brain were found to increase at 2 h and a high level was maintained for 14 days. The morphology of the basement membrane of capillaries was observed using anti-blood-brain barrier basement membrane glycoprotein immunohistochemistry. The normal continuous linear or ribbon-like immunostain of the basement membrane became granular at 0.5 h, gradually faint and finally negative. The newly formed capillaries at the edge of the infarct still showed a negative stain after 14 days. The result suggested the optimal time window of exo-bFGF began 2 h after insult. The second part of experiment was to observe the dynamic expression of early growth response protein (Egr-1), endogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (endo-bFGF) and bFGF receptor (bFGFR) using immunohistochemistry after exo-bFGF is administered to brain. Egr-1 was more significantly enhanced in the exo-bFGF-used group than in the control group. Endo-bFGF increased gradually, reaching its peak at 7 days in the control group, while in experiment group, the endo-bFGF expression showed its first peak at 6 h, indicating that exo-bFGF could induce earlier and stronger expression of endo-bFGF. The bFGFR-group presented an early expression, reaching its maximal level at 3 h, and declining at 6 h. There were no difference in expression of bFGFR between the two groups. The infarct areas reduced from 17% to 24% in the different time intervals. The results suggested that in exo-bFGF enhanced Egr-1 protein. Egr-1 in turn might play an important role in up-regulating the expression of endo-bFGF which overlapped with the expression of bFGFR to ensure the combination of ligand and receptor to protect against brain ischemia.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":99,"end":102}},{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":384,"end":388}},{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":483,"end":487}},{"obj":"Species:255564","span":{"begin":532,"end":536}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":58,"end":62}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":183,"end":213}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":91,"end":95}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":219,"end":223}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":340,"end":344}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":454,"end":458}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":545,"end":549}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":1097,"end":1101}},{"obj":"Gene:24330","span":{"begin":1228,"end":1233}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":1247,"end":1277}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":1284,"end":1288}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":1294,"end":1307}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":1309,"end":1314}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":1353,"end":1357}},{"obj":"Gene:24330","span":{"begin":1384,"end":1389}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":1433,"end":1437}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":1481,"end":1485}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":1593,"end":1597}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":1659,"end":1663}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":1717,"end":1721}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":1727,"end":1732}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":1869,"end":1874}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":2008,"end":2012}},{"obj":"Gene:24330","span":{"begin":2022,"end":2027}},{"obj":"Gene:24330","span":{"begin":2037,"end":2042}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":2120,"end":2124}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":2165,"end":2170}},{"obj":"Disease:D002545","span":{"begin":103,"end":117}},{"obj":"Disease:D002545","span":{"begin":228,"end":242}},{"obj":"Disease:D007511","span":{"begin":557,"end":565}},{"obj":"Disease:D007238","span":{"begin":992,"end":999}},{"obj":"Disease:D007238","span":{"begin":1903,"end":1910}},{"obj":"Disease:D002545","span":{"begin":2239,"end":2253}}]}
