{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "12888313","text":"SU6668 in idiopathic myelofibrosis--a rational therapeutic approach targeting several tyrosine kinases of importance for the myeloproliferation and the development of bone marrow fibrosis and angiogenesis. Idiopathic myelofibrosis is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder being featured by progressive accumulation of connective tissue in concert with marked neovascularization (angiogenesis) of the bone marrow. Both fibrogenesis and angiogenesis are considered to develop consequent to the intramedullary release of various growth-promoting factors from rapidly proliferating and dysplastic megakaryocytes. Among these growth factors are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The protein kinase inhibitor SU6668 is a potent antiangiogenic inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases, including those of VEGFR, PDGFR, bFGFR, and c-kit. The hypothesis is that SU6668 may be an effective agent in the treatment of idiopathic myelofibrosis. This compound has an inhibitory target profile on several tyrosine kinases involved in the myeloproliferation, the development of myeloid metaplasia (bFGFR, PDGFR, VEGFR, and c-kit) and the development of the major stromal changes in the bone marrow - fibrosis and angiogenesis (bFGFR, PDGFR, and VEGFR).","denotations":[{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":679,"end":709}},{"obj":"Gene:2247","span":{"begin":711,"end":715}},{"obj":"Gene:7040","span":{"begin":718,"end":749}},{"obj":"Gene:7040","span":{"begin":751,"end":759}},{"obj":"Gene:7422","span":{"begin":765,"end":799}},{"obj":"Gene:7422","span":{"begin":801,"end":805}},{"obj":"Gene:3791","span":{"begin":930,"end":935}},{"obj":"Gene:5159","span":{"begin":937,"end":942}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":944,"end":949}},{"obj":"Gene:3815","span":{"begin":955,"end":960}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1214,"end":1219}},{"obj":"Gene:5159","span":{"begin":1221,"end":1226}},{"obj":"Gene:3791","span":{"begin":1228,"end":1233}},{"obj":"Gene:3815","span":{"begin":1239,"end":1244}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1343,"end":1348}},{"obj":"Gene:5159","span":{"begin":1350,"end":1355}},{"obj":"Gene:3791","span":{"begin":1361,"end":1366}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:18186","span":{"begin":1122,"end":1130}},{"obj":"Chemical:C412603","span":{"begin":985,"end":991}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:18186","span":{"begin":893,"end":901}},{"obj":"Chemical:C412603","span":{"begin":837,"end":843}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:18186","span":{"begin":86,"end":94}},{"obj":"Chemical:C412603","span":{"begin":0,"end":6}},{"obj":"Disease:D055728","span":{"begin":217,"end":230}},{"obj":"Disease:D055728","span":{"begin":21,"end":34}},{"obj":"Disease:D002908","span":{"begin":236,"end":271}},{"obj":"Disease:D055728","span":{"begin":167,"end":187}},{"obj":"Disease:D004416","span":{"begin":582,"end":592}},{"obj":"Disease:D055728","span":{"begin":1049,"end":1062}},{"obj":"Disease:D055728","span":{"begin":1194,"end":1212}},{"obj":"Disease:D005355","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1324}}]}
