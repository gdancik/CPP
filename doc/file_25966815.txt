UNASSIGNED: A universal signaling module has been described which utilizes the nuclear form of Fibroblast growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1) in a central role directing the post-mitotic development of neural cells through coordinated gene expression. In this review, we discuss in detail the current knowledge of FGFR1 nuclear interaction partners in three scenarios: (i) Engagement of FGFR1 in neuronal stem cells and regulation of neuronal differentiation; (ii) interaction with the orphan receptor Nurr1 in development of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons; (iii) modulation of nuclear FGFR1 interactions downstream of nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling. These coalitions demonstrate the versatility of non-canonical, nuclear tyrosine kinase signaling in diverse cellular differentiation programs of neurons. J. Cell.
