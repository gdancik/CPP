{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "9603246","text":"Differential localization of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, -2, -3, and -4 in fetal, immature, and adult rat testes. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are essential for embryonic development and have been implicated in testis development and function. The effects of FGFs are mediated through four high-affinity receptors (FGFRs), which have different binding affinities for each of the ligands. We have used indirect avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase-enhanced immunohistochemistry to localize FGFR-1, -2, -3, and -4 in fetal, immature, and adult rat testes. In the fetal testis, immunoreactivity for FGFR-1 was seen in gonocytes, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and mesenchyme, and FGFR-3 was localized in gonocytes. In the immature testis, FGFR-1 was localized to spermatogonia, and all four FGFRs were localized in pachytene spermatocytes, immature adultlike Leydig cells, and peritubular cells. In the adult testis epithelium, Sertoli cells were immunoreactive for FGFR-4, and germ cells were immunoreactive for all four FGFRs, with specific receptors localized to specific stages of germ cell development. In the adult testis interstitium, FGFR-1, -2, and -4 were localized in Leydig cells, and FGFR-1 and -4 were also localized in peritubular cells. The discrete cell- and stage-specific localization of FGFRs in the fetal, immature, and adult rat testis suggests that FGFs exert specific roles through these receptors in spermatogenesis, Leydig cell function, and testicular development.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":111,"end":114}},{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":555,"end":558}},{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1358}},{"obj":"Gene:79114;25022;84489;25114","span":{"begin":29,"end":80}},{"obj":"Gene:79114;25022;84489;25114","span":{"begin":502,"end":524}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":609,"end":615}},{"obj":"Gene:84489","span":{"begin":688,"end":694}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":747,"end":753}},{"obj":"Gene:25114","span":{"begin":974,"end":980}},{"obj":"Gene:79114;25022;25114","span":{"begin":1150,"end":1168}},{"obj":"Gene:79114;25114","span":{"begin":1205,"end":1218}},{"obj":"Chemical:D001710","span":{"begin":430,"end":436}}]}
