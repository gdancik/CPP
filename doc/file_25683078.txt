UNASSIGNED: Abstract A series of 5,7-dimethyl-oxazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidine-4,6(5H,7H)-dione derivatives, N5a-5l, was designed, synthesized and evaluated for their FGFR1-inhibition ability as well as cytotoxicity against three cancer cell lines (H460, B16F10 and A549) in vitro. Several compounds displayed good-to-excellent potency against these cancer cell lines compared to SU5402. Structure-activity relationship analyses indicated that compounds with a rigid structure and more heteroatoms at the side chain of the parent ring were more effective than those without these substitutions. The compound N5g (37.4% FGFR1 inhibition at 1.0    M) was identified to have the most potent antitumor activities, with IC50 values of 5.472, 4.260 and 5.837    M against H460, B16F10 and A549 cell lines, respectively. Together, our results suggest that 5,7-dimethyl-oxazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidine-4,6(5H,7H)-dione derivatives may serve as potential agents for the treatment of FGFR1-mediated cancers.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:9606","span":{"begin":923,"end":927}},{"obj":"Species:10090","span":{"begin":929,"end":935}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":158,"end":163}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":324,"end":329}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":776,"end":781}},{"obj":"Gene:2260","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1129}},{"obj":"Chemical:C105686","span":{"begin":537,"end":543}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":387,"end":393}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":507,"end":513}},{"obj":"Disease:D009369","span":{"begin":1139,"end":1146}}]}
