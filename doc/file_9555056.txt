{"sourcedb": "PubMed","sourceid": "9555056","text":"Lipid metabolism in fibroblast growth factor-stimulated L6 myoblasts: a receptor mutation (Y766F) abrogates phospholipase D and diacylglycerol kinase activities. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was studied in rat L6 myoblasts expressing the wild-type FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) or a mutant (Y766F) that is incapable of activating phospholipase C-gamma (PLCgamma). Stimulation of FGFR-1 activated phospholipase D (PLD) rapidly and transiently, but did not induce PC-specific PLC activity. Downregulation of protein kinase C blocked bFGF-induced PLD activation but not phosphatidic acid formation by diacylglycerol (DG) kinase. Only phosphoinositide (PI)-derived DG, not PC-derived DG, appeared to be a substrate for DG kinase. Stimulation of FGFR-1(Y766F) did not activate PLD or DG kinase, both of which apparently require initial PLCgamma activation. The Y766F mutation reduced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation but not cell proliferation. We conclude that both PI turnover and PC hydrolysis are dispensable for bFGF-induced mitogenesis.","denotations":[{"obj":"Species:10116","span":{"begin":262,"end":265}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":209,"end":239}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":241,"end":245}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":304,"end":318}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":320,"end":326}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":429,"end":435}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":581,"end":585}},{"obj":"Gene:79114","span":{"begin":791,"end":803}},{"obj":"Gene:54250","span":{"begin":1073,"end":1077}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:41847","span":{"begin":648,"end":662}},{"obj":"Chemical:D010712","span":{"begin":617,"end":634}},{"obj":"Chemical:CHEBI:41847","span":{"begin":128,"end":142}},{"obj":"Chemical:D010713","span":{"begin":162,"end":181}},{"obj":"Mutation:p|SUB|Y|766|F","span":{"begin":91,"end":96}},{"obj":"Mutation:p|SUB|Y|766|F","span":{"begin":341,"end":346}},{"obj":"Mutation:p|SUB|Y|766|F","span":{"begin":798,"end":803}},{"obj":"Mutation:p|SUB|Y|766|F","span":{"begin":906,"end":911}}]}
